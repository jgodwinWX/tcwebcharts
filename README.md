# tcwebcharts

no_active.py - Generates a blank map showing that there are no active storms.
web_chart.py - Generates an Atlantic basin overview map of active storms, their history, and their names.
zoom_chart.py - Creates a zoomed in map for an active tropical cyclone, and draws its wind radii. Also
                prints out the active storm info (max winds, min pressure, lat, and lon).

You will need a best-track file, which you can get from http://hurricanes.ral.ucar.edu/realtime/current/
by selecting an active storm, then looking for the "history file (b-deck)" under "ATCF data files".
